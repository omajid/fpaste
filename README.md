fpaste
======

**This code is now no longer maintained.** Please use
[this version of fpaste.el](http://git.sergiodj.net/?p=fpaste-el.git)
instead. It provides almost everything that this code does, but does
it without requiring the `fpaste` program being available.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

A program to upload selections to the fedora pastebin. Needs the
`fpaste` command line program to work.
